# 'directory' is defined in rails plugin loading, and since we are eval'd
# instead of required, we get it here.  But radiant seems to require or load
# instead of eval, so work with it.  Also it can be defined as a function during
# migrations for some reason.

# Monkey patch into the core classes.
#
# There are two ways to do this, if you are patching into a core class
# like ActiveRecord::Base then you can include a class defined by a file
# in this plugin's lib directory
#
# ActiveRecord::Base.send :include, MyClassInLibDirectory
#
# If you are patching a class in the current application, such as a specific
# model that will get reloaded by the dependencies mechanism (in development
# mode) you will need your extension to be reloaded each time the application
# is reset, so use the hook we provide for you.
